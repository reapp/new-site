### What is it?

Reapp is everything you need to build amazing apps with React: a collection of
packages that work together, our UI kit, and a CLI that scaffolds your app and includes
a server and build system.

### Examples

We have two example apps with full source code:

 - [Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/reapp/kitchen-sink) ([demo](http://kitchen.reapp.io))
 - [Hacker News Reader](https://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app) ([demo](http://hn.reapp.io))

### Installation

Installation is done through npm, though you can pick and choose any pieces you'd like
and roll your own stack.

```
npm install -g reapp
```

Generate a new base reapp stack with:

```
reapp new [name]
```

And finally in your app directory, run it on [localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010):

```
reapp run
```

### CLI Options

The CLI helps with two main functions. The first is creating new apps.
For now, it simply makes a bare clone of a repo we keep updated with the current best practices.
The goal is to eventually have a variety of baseline repos from which to choose.

It also lets you run your app, using [reapp-server](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-server),
a simple express server that works well with the default app structure.

CLI Usage:
```
Usage: reapp [command]

  new [name]  creates a directory with a new reapp-starter scaffolding
  run         runs a reapp application with express/webpack-dev-server
  build       builds a reapp application to a bundle in ./build
  debug       use this for opening issues
```

The build and run commands take a variety of options to help ease your development, such as:

```
Usage: reapp-run [options]

  -d, --debug          output extra information for debugging
  -p, --port [number]  specify a port [number]
  -h, --host [host]    specify hostname
  -b, --bind [address] specify bind address if different from host
  -e, --env [env]      specify an environment
  -t, --tool [tool]    specify a webpack devtool
```

```
Usage: reapp-build [options]

  -d, --debug  output extra information for debugging
  --no-assets  only build the js
  --no-js      only build the assets
```

### Running & Building

Use `reapp run` to serve your app locally by default at [localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010).
The `run` command has a few options to help you out:

- `reapp run -d` (debug) to output information on how it's running your app
- `reapp run -e production` (env=production) to run your app in production mode, which is much faster
- `reapp run -t source-map` (tool=source-map) to have full source maps rather than the "eval" style default source maps

You also have the same flags available to build commands.

The `build` command is used once you're ready to deploy your app (to either the web or a device via Cordova). For now, we provide two types of builds:

- `reapp build` by default sets the platform to **web**, for mobile sites.
- `reapp build ios` targets Cordova iOS devices.

When you run `reapp build` you'll notice a new `./build` folder where your assets have been copied to.
For example, `reapp build ios` will build to `./build/ios`. `reapp build` goes to `./build/web`.

It will also copy your assets for you. Here's an example of running `reapp build ios`:

```
./assets/shared/* => ./build/ios
./assets/ios/* => ./build/ios
./assets/ios/index.html => (Webpack inserts CSS/JS references) => ./build/ios/index.html
```

This allows a lot of flexibility. You can share assets between builds or have
exclusive ones for a platform. Leave an asset in the base `./assets` folder
and it won't be copied at all, but you can still `require()` it within your app.

A good case for shared assets is your Cordova config.xml. Leave it in `./assets/shared`
and it'll create output for all your builds.

[See more on custom builds](#custom-builds).

### Structure of your application

You can see the exact app that's generated through the [reapp-starter repo](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-starter).
Only the `/app/app.js` entry point and `/assets/web/index.html` is "necessary".
For now, it's very simple:

```
/app
  /components
  /theme
  app.js
  routes.js
/assets
  /web
    index.html
  /ios
    index.html
  /shared
/config (optional)
```

`/app/app.js` is your entry point. Everything in the app folder should be pretty
self-explanatory. `/assets` contains static assets as explained in the [Running & Building](#running-and-building) section. In general, you'll place your assets into
`shared` or the specific platform subdirectory.

The `/theme` folder is [reapp-ui](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui)-specific. You can
find docs for it in the repo, but it also should be pretty easy to understand.

If you place a `build.webpack.js` or `run.webpack.js` in your `/config` dir, the reapp CLI
will use these configs when you run `reapp build` or `reapp run`.
To see some example configs, check out the files in the `./config` folder of the
[reapp-pack repo](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-pack).

### Your First App

There are a number of pieces we've included in a reapp app. Let's explore a few
of them in the most likely order of encountering them in your codebase. Think of this
as a tour of a reapp app, introducing each package as we encounter them.

You can check out the [reapp project on Github](https://github.com/reapp) for more info.

To start, you'll want to open `./package.json`. Notice we have the following packages:
- [reapp-routes](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-routes) (Routes generator)
- [reapp-ui](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui) (UI Kit)
- [reapp](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui) (CLI)
- [reapp-platform](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-platform) (Base utils)
- [reapp-component](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-component) (DI and Factories)

You also have an entry point defined as `app/app.js`. This starts your app.
The most important part here is the routing. Let's start there.

#### [reapp-routes](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-routes) (Routes generator)

reapp-routes is a DRY nested route-to-directory mapping system. As long as
your routes map to your component file structure, you can save lots of time
and enforce consistency in your app, a win-win.

Notice how the import looks for `reapp-routes/react-router`.
The first import in app.js is your router. We love react-router, so we included
a reapp-routes generator for that by default, but you could write your own.

You'll notice that the pre-defined routes all perfectly map to the structure of
`./app/components`. To see more about how this works, check out reapp-routes.

This is the reapp-routes syntax. The key to note here is the `require` that
is passed to the routes function at the top level, which is how it dynamically
requires your components based on the route tree.

#### [reapp-ui](https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui) (UI Kit)

The next theme we require is the `./app/theme.js` file. reapp-ui has it's own
documentation, but themes are the core of reapp-ui. They need three things:
constants, styles, and animations. You can just use the included iOS theme,
but we've included the `./app/theme` folder as an example of how you can easily
customize themes.

### Custom builds

Reapp-pack takes in an object that lets you configure your builds. To read more on
the options that takes, see the [reapp-pack readme](http://github.com/reapp/reapp-pack).

Reapp will automatically look for your build files, and you can override the defaults if
you'd like. If you don't have a config folder, it will just use the defaults.

The way it looks for config files:

- `reapp run` looks for:
  - `./config/run.config.js`
  - `reapp-pack/config/run.js`

- `reapp build` looks for:
  - `./config/build.config.js`
  - `reapp-pack/config/build.js`

- `reapp build [platform]` looks for:
  - `./config/build.[platform].config.js`
  - `reapp-pack/config/build.[platform].js`

### Why Reapp?

Reapp wasn't built purposefully to be a framework. Instead, it started
as a UI kit. From that kit, two apps were built. While this isn't a lot,
it was enough to see repetition between the two that could be extracted.

From those two apps, over a period of months, we extracted a set of
packages, ensuring to keep each of them completely independent. It was
an experiment in seeing if a framework was necessary.

What we found was this: if you can subscribe to a certain file structure,
you can avoid the framework. With that file structure, we can provide
helpers via a CLI. Bootstrap your app in one command and you have a mature
build system built in, without having to do anything.

Really, Reapp is simple. You could even just use the UI kit and roll your own
app. We just went through that headache, and decided to make it easier to
avoid it if you like how we make apps.

### Roadmap

Our initial goals are simple: focus on completeness, consistency, and performance.
Also, a theme for Android.

Down the road we'd like to achieve the following:

- **Isomorphic** - Render first on server, pass data over
to client to continue from there (easily achievable).
- **Responsive** - Support for tablet style interfaces
and JS-powered responsive styling.
- **Physics** - A spring based physics library
into the animation library with an easy syntax.
- **Interaction** - A simple, declarative interaction
library that can be composed well with reapp

### Development Environment

Sublime users, [here's a guide](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/lint-like-it-s-2015-6987d44c5b48)
for getting syntax highlighting, snippets and linting that works with babel.
